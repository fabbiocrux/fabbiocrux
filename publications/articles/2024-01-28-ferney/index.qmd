abstract: "This research proposes a competence-based role model as a methodological basis for guiding the conformation of social innovation lab (SI lab) teams. Based on a comprehensive literature review including the comparison of 7 innovation team frameworks and a set of 14 competences for SI lab teams, a model consisting of the roles of facilitator, maker, visionary and manager is proposed. Applied to 10 nascent SI lab teams from Latin American universities, the self-assessment methodology provides an interpretative approach for SI lab teams to position themselves with regards to their competence profile and proposed roles, while identifying strategies for improvement."
