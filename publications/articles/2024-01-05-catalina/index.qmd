## Abstract

The high volume of plastic waste and the extremely low recycling rate have created  a serious challenge worldwide. Local distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) offers a solution by economically incentivizing local recycling. One  DRAM technology capable of processing large quantities of plastic waste is fused  granular fabrication, where solid shredded plastic waste can be reused directly as  3D printing feedstock. This study presents an experimental assessment of multimaterial recycling printability using two of the most common thermoplastics in the  beverage industry, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene  (HDPE), and the feasibility of mixing PET and HDPE to be used as a feedstock  material for large-scale 3-D printing. After the material collection, shredding, and  cleaning, the characterization and optimization of parameters for 3D printing were  performed. Results showed the feasibility of printing a large object from rPET/  rHDPE flakes, reducing production costs by up to 88%.
