# Personal website for<br>Fabio A. Cruz Sanchez


Hello, this is the repo for [my personal website](https://fabbiocrux.com/)!

This version was made using the [Blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/index.html) R package, the [Hugo ApÃ©ro theme](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/) and the inspiration of [Silvia Canelon](https://www.silviacanelon.com/)

I let this repository public so that people can dive and learn how to recreate what they like for their own site. This is how I learned! ðŸ™Œ

You can find excellent documentation on how to create and customize your own Hugo ApÃ©ro site at https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/learn/. ðŸ¥‚

Thanks and happy repo-diving! ðŸ¤¿ <a href='https://app.netlify.com/sites/fabbiocrux/deploys'><img src='https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d488fa80-fd48-4907-96c5-f6e4d41c1394/deploy-status' align="right" height="20" alt='Netlify Status'/></a>
