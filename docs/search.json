    "text": "Abstract\nWe all aim to use data to tell a compelling story, and many of us enjoy sharing how we got there by open-sourcing our code, but we don’t always share our story with everyone. Even kind, supportive, and open communities like the #TidyTuesday R learning community on Twitter has a ways to go before the content shared can be accessible to everyone.Lived experiences of blind R users tell us that most data visualizations shared for TidyTuesday are inaccessible to screen reading technology because they lack alternative text (i.e. alt text) descriptions. Our goal was to bring this hidden lack of accessibility to the surface by examining the alternative text accompanying data visualizations shared as part of the TidyTuesday social project.We scraped the alternative text from 6,443 TidyTuesday images posted on Twitter between April 2, 2018 and January 31, 2021. The first image attached to each tweet was considered the primary image and was scraped for alternative text. Manual web inspection revealed the CSS class and HTML element corresponding to the primary image, as well as the attribute containing the alternative text. We used this information and the ROpenSci {RSelenium} package to scrape the alternative text. Our preliminary analysis found that only 2.4% of the images contained a text description entered by the tweet author compared to 84% which were described by default as ‘Image.’This small group of intentional alternative text descriptions had a median word count of 18 (range: 1-170), and a median character count of 83 (range: 8-788). As a reference point, Twitter allows 240 characters in a single tweet and 1,000 characters for image descriptions. This analysis was made possible thanks to a dataset of historical TidyTuesday tweet data collected using the ROpenSci {rtweet} package, and openly available in the TidyTuesday GitHub repository.We will present during Session 0 on May 4, 2021: Crowdcast Link"

Our study describes a cohort of TBI patients within the Penn Medicine health system and the distribution of TBI injury mechanisms and severity.\n\n\nMethods\nWe obtained Electronic Health Record data for 1,060,100 female patients treated at Penn Medicine inpatient or outpatient clinics from 2010-2017. We identified patients with TBI diagnoses using ICD-9/10 codes and the Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Defense (DOD) definitions for TBI and TBI severity. The CDC/DOD codes for TBI were then manually annotated with mechanisms of TBI injury (e.g. Sport Mechanism of Injury, Collision or Crash, Foreign Body Object). The highest TBI severity category was noted for each patient and defined, in increasing severity, as “Mild,” “Moderate,” “Severe,” or “Penetrating.” We report the distribution of TBI mechanisms and severity among this patient population.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 4,392 patients with a total of 9,800 TBI diagnoses. The majority of diagnoses in the cohort were Mild (5,704; 58%), followed by Moderate (3,840; 39%), Severe (173; 1.8%), and Penetrating (83; 0.8%). The following are the six most common mechanisms observed to contribute to TBI diagnoses: “Injury,” “Mechanism of Injury,” “Accidents,” “Physical Accidents,” “Fall Mechanism of Injury,” and “Traffic Vehicle Accident.”"

    "section": "Why port to Quarto?",
    "text": "Why port to Quarto?\nQuarto is a new and powerful technical publishing system in active development, natively friendly to a variety of programming languages and IDEs. There are countless features available in Quarto that I was interested in having access to in my website, so I’ll list just my top five:\n\nFlexibility in design. Quarto offers options for website navigation (top navigation vs. side navigation), “about” pages like the postcard landing pages that a lot of folks use in their distill sites, listing pages that are generated from a list of documents, among others. These components would act like modules that I could combine to design a site that truly fit my needs.\nFlexibility in content layout. With Quarto I would gain the ability to organize content in ways I hadn’t even dreamt of. Tables and figures could be laid out across multiple columns and rows as sub-tables and sub-figures of a panel. How much of the page the content took up would be up to me. Content could even go in the margin! 🤩 \nFreezing computations. Quarto would give me the option to freeze posts containing executable code. This was huge for me, because updating my blogdown site always produced a little bit of anxiety. I used to worry that blogdown might try to re-render old R Markdown blog posts and break things! 😱\nSite search. With content spread out over blog posts, talks, publications, and projects, I wanted site visitors (including myself!) to be able to keyword search for something in particular. Tags and categories in blogdown would get me part of the way there, but Quarto offers built-in search capability.\nEmbedding computations. Ok this is a feature that I learned about a week ago at posit::conf(2023) from Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s talk “Reproducible Manuscripts with Quarto.” Mine demo’d pulling a table from a .qmd file and a figure from an .ipynb file into the same manuscript .qmd file, without having to execute the source code again! 👀 This is a game changer for anyone compiling results from computations performed in different files, and in my personal site I could see it coming in handy if I have a series of blog posts with outputs that I want to cross-reference. Currently we can only embed computations from Jupyter notebook files, but hopefully we’ll be able to embed .qmd computations in Quarto v1.4! 🤞🏽\nI mean, it’s pretty cool that content can go in the margin, right??  It could even be a picture: The book page reads verdere expedities which is Dutch for “further expeditions”"

    "section": "The cost of porting",
    "text": "The cost of porting\nGaining the aforementioned Quarto functionality did not come without a cost. To me, the biggest cost was the aesthetics – the Hugo Apéro theme is quite lovely! – but I customized my Quarto site enough to reflect the design aspects I loved the most. More on styling later. Some other costs included:\n\n\nLoss of the sidebar layout. The Apéro theme has options for adding a nicely styled sidebar that I had been using for my blog. It included a featured image and details about the individual post like tags, categories, length, etc. All of this information is available in Quarto posts, it’s just organized a little differently.\nExample of the sidebar\n\n\n\n\nLoss of Utterances comments. Any interactions with folks through Utteranc.es comments did not transfer over, and I’ll miss them. The few comments on my site have been very kind (see example below) and I’ve really enjoy reading them!\nExample of Utterances comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Oct. 12, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Emily Riederer, I’m happy to report this is a non-issue! See her tips in the comments at the end of the post, or on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nHugo Apéro collections. The Apéro theme had a way of bundling together posts that were related into a collection of posts. Garrick and I used this feature for our user!2021 xaringan workshop and it worked well to organize learning materials for different sections of our workshop. If I wanted something like this in the future, I would probably use Quarto’s sidebar navigation feature like Andrew Bray did in his Rmd to Quarto workshop for rstudio::conf(2022).\nName pronunciation on the About page. Apéro had a built-in option for adding an audio clip under your name that you could use to help people learn how your name is pronounced. I never used this feature myself, but if I wanted to, I could look to Emil Hvitfeldt’s site as an example.\nRedirects. The Apéro theme gave me the option to define the combination of date information and URL slugs for each of my posts, and I had them set up as year-slug (e.g., blog/2023-hello-quarto). Quarto does not offer that functionality and strictly creates URLs for posts based on the filepath (e.g., blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto). In order to continue using my year-month-day-slug naming convention for my post folders, I had to set up redirects from the old URLs to the new ones so that there wouldn’t be broken links sprinkled throughout the internet. More on redirects later."

I used an about page layout for both my home and about pages, and listing pages to generate a list of blog posts, talks, publications, and projects. There was also some custom CSS involved, but we haven’t gotten to that part of the blog post yet wink 😉 Dear reader, it’s at this point in my blog post drafting that I start realizing that what was meant to be a brief post is turning into a novel (sigh)\nOne of the aspects I liked about my Apéro site was that the About page highlighted the most recent posts from the blog, talk, publication, and project groups. In my Quarto site, I achieved this by including a one-entry listing grid for each group on my About page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS tip\n\n\n\n\n\nThese listing cards looked great on a wide screen but as the screen got narrower (think mobile device) the listing cards just became narrower and narrower 😂.

I saw a great example on Michael McCarthy’s Tidy Tales blog, site and did a little repo-diving to get ideas on how to organize the content. I ended up using the Bootstrap CSS Grid to layout the content exactly how I wanted to. See what I mean about Quarto offering a lot of flexibility in content layout?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBones of the contact page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontact.qmd\n\n\n&lt;!-- start grid --&gt;\n::: {.grid} \n\n&lt;!-- column for the body text --&gt;\n::: {.g-col-5}\n\n# Send me a note\n\n&lt; Body text&gt;\n\n&lt; HTML code for social media icons &gt;\n\n:::\n\n&lt;!-- column for spacing --&gt;\n::: {.g-col-1}\n:::\n\n&lt;!-- column for the form --&gt;\n::: {.g-col-6}\n\n&lt; HTML embed code provided by Formspree &gt;\n\n:::\n\n:::\n&lt;!-- end grid --&gt;\n\n source code"

    "section": "Adapting old posts",
    "text": "Adapting old posts\nYAML fields\nOk so once I figured out how to incorporate all of the structural elements I wanted, I had to deal with the (relatively small) challenge of porting my old posts to Quarto. Quarto was designed to be compatible with existing R Markdown documents, but I didn’t actually want it trying to re-render old R Markdown files so I had Quarto ignore those completely2 and render the Markdown version of each post instead3. There were also a handful of YAML fields that I had to remove or modify to play nicely with Quarto:\n\nRemove layout: (e.g., layout: single-sidebar)\nRemove publishDate\n\nRemove lastUpdated\n\nRemove featured (e.g., featured: yes)\nMerge categories with tags and keep tags\n\nAdd image (e.g. image: featured.png)\nPartials\nIf you’ve used Apéro you might have come to love the cute button links created from the links field in the YAML, like the one at the top of this post, pointing to the Quarto docs.\nlinks:\n- icon: journal-text\n  name: Quarto Docs\n  url: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/\nWell, these button links are not ready-made by Quarto, but lucky for me (us!), Garrick figured out a way to bring them in right where we I need them. I repo-dived and found that he modified an HTML partial for title blocks, which controls the layout and styling of the post title, description, and tags, shown at the top of the page.\nThe original title block partial has sections controlling the placement and styling of text provided in the title, subtitle, authors, date, and abstract fields of the document YAML.\nAs an example, line 2 might read:If there’s something in the title field of the YAML, give it a level 1 heading and style it with CSS class .title\n\n\ngithub.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/src/resources/formats/html/pandoc/title-block.html\n\n&lt;header id=\"title-block-header\"&gt;\n$if(title)$&lt;h1 class=\"title\"&gt;$title$&lt;/h1&gt;$endif$\n$if(subtitle)$\n&lt;p class=\"subtitle\"&gt;$subtitle$&lt;/p&gt;\n$endif$\n$for(author)$\n&lt;p class=\"author\"&gt;$author$&lt;/p&gt;\n$endfor$\n\n$if(date)$\n&lt;p class=\"date\"&gt;$date$&lt;/p&gt;\n$endif$\n$if(abstract)$\n&lt;div class=\"abstract\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"abstract-title\"&gt;$abstract-title$&lt;/div&gt;\n$abstract$\n&lt;/div&gt;\n$endif$\n&lt;/header&gt;\n\nThe modified partial  includes some additional sections but I’ll break down the one for links.\nThere’s more styling going on in the modified partial, but starting on line 6, the structure for the link buttons is effectively:If the links field is populated in the YAML, create an HTML container styled by some CSS, and give it some specific HTML properies.Then, for each sub-item of the links field: create a hyperlink from the url sub-item, apply some CSS classes to create the button, add a Bootstrap icon defined by the icon sub-item, and finally add hyperlink text defined by the name sub-item.\n\n\n_partials/title-block-link-buttons/title-block.html\n\n&lt;header id=\"title-block-header\" class=\"quarto-title-block default page-columns\"&gt;\n...\n$if(links)$\n&lt;div class=\"mt-4 d-flex flex-row flex-wrap gap-1 justify-content-left justify-content-sm-start\" role=\"group\" aria-label=\"Links\"&gt;\n$for(links)$\n&lt;a href=\"$links.url$\" class=\"btn btn-secondary text-capitalize\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"bi bi-$links.icon$ me-1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;$links.name$&lt;/a&gt;\n$endfor$\n&lt;/div&gt;\n$endif$\n...\n&lt;/header&gt;"

    "title": "Hello Quarto: Porting my Website from Hugo Apéro",
    "section": "Styling the site",
    "text": "Styling the site\nSCSS variables\nI may have published my brand new Quarto site in the fall of 2023, but I had actually taken my first go at porting it from Apéro in the fall of 2022. In an attempt to replicate the styling of my old site I tried to strong-arm my Quarto site into using tachyons4, and I wrote way too much custom CSS in the process 😩.\nSomething didn’t feel right about it, so I took a break and came back to my in-progress Quarto site several months later – outside of the Quarto release craze, and with the perspective that I wanted to work with the built-in theming capabilities, rather than against them 😌. This time around I leaned into the Bootstrap SCSS variables, and added custom styling as needed.\nTo be more specific, I created a custom theme 5, and populated it with definitions for some of the built-in Bootstrap Sass variables. If you poke around my custom theme, you will notice that some colors are defined by color variables that start with $spc-. These are variables pointing to colors that I’ve defined elsewhere, and they can be replaced with a hex code of your choosing! 🎨\n\n\nassets/silvia-theme.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n\n// Colors\n$primary:                    $spc-primary-light;\n$secondary:                  $spc-secondary;\n\nThe Sass variables listed in the documentation got me pretty far, but there were still elements of my site using default colors and styling that I wanted to change. So I repo-dived to learn about additional Quarto Bootstrap variables and rules:\n\nBootstrap variables: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/_bootstrap-variables.scss\n\nBootstrap rules: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/_bootstrap-rules.scss\n\n\nTo give you an example, someone in the Quarto Discussions forum asked how to set the color of block quotes, figure captions, and outlines, something not defined in the documentation. One of the replies suggested using the browser’s inspector to find the CSS rule applied to the element in question, we’ll say the figure caption, and then looking at how Quarto implemented that rule. I’ll make that process a little more explicit here and use the figure caption as an example:\n\nUse the browser inspector to highlight a figure caption\nThe inspector will reveal that the element is styled by CSS class .figure-caption\nRun a keyword search for “figure-caption” in the Bootstrap variables file. This will yield no results 🤔\n\nRun the same keyword search in the Bootstrap rules file – success! We have a clue, which is that .figure-caption is styled by a variable named body-secondary 🔍\n.panel-caption,\n.figure-caption,\n.subfigure-caption,\n.table-caption,\nfigcaption.quarto-float-caption,\ncaption {\n  font-size: 0.9rem;\n  @include body-secondary;\n}\n\n\nDefine your own body-secondary color variable in your custom theme file\n\n\nassets/custom-theme.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n\n$body-secondary: #6C757D;\n\n\nEnjoy the fruits of your labor as a CSS detective 🕵🏽‍♀️\nIndividual page styling\nIn some cases, I wanted to style individual pages differently than I was styling my entire site. Poking around Garrick’s repo (again!), I learned that you can reference CSS stylesheets in the YAML of any particular document. I used this approach to separately style my Home, About, and listing pages.\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\nexecute: \n  freeze: false\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n\n\n\nindex.qmd  source code\n\n\nassets/index.css  source code\n\nBackground image for title blocks\nOk one of the aesthetic pieces I was excited to add to my Quarto site that I didn’t have in my old site is a featured image at the top of each post. I was inspired by Matt Worthington’s site while I was reading one of his excellent blog posts on a workflow for interactive maps in R – I loved that the title block included an image in the background! 🤩\nAfter some web inspecting and repo-diving in Matt’s website repo I came up with some styling that I could apply to the title block of each post. It took modifying the title block partial described earlier, and adding some CSS to my custom theme.\nFor styling that I wanted to apply uniformly to all post title blocks, I created a .featured-image CSS class in my custom theme:\nDon’t miss the code annotations for this code chunk! 👀 Such a cool feature!\n\n\nassets/custom-theme.scss\n\n  // style background image on posts\n  .featured-image {\n1    background-size: cover;\n2    background-position: center;\n3    color: white;\n4    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1000px rgba(0,38,66,0.75);\n  }\n\n\n1\n\nHave the image cover the background\n\n2\n\nCenter the image\n\n3\n\nMake the overlaying text color white\n\n4\n\nAdd shadowing that gives the appearance of a dark overlay\n\n\nAlright, but why didn’t I use a background-image property to define the image? If I define the background image in my .featured-image class then that is the image that’s going to show up in all of the posts across my site. I want the title block of each post to display the featured image belonging to each individual post. That’s where the partial comes back in.\n\n\n_partials/title-block-link-buttons/title-block.html\n\n&lt;div \nid=\"title-block-header-title\" \nclass=\"quarto-title page-columns page-full page-layout-full featured-image p-4\" \nstyle=\"background-image: url(featured.png), url(featured.jpg), url(../featured.jpg);\"&gt;\n...\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nAlong with some other CSS classes, the div container for the title block is styled with the featured-image class defined earlier, using the class= property. In addition, the div itself is styled using the style= property, and that’s where I defined the background image. The partial will look for a featured image of some kind either in the same folder as the post, or in the parent folder, and display it in the background of the title block.\nThis is a hacky way of getting what I really want which is for the partial to check for a featured image in the order I specify and then just stop once it finds one. As it stands right now, the styling attempts to layer on all three images, with the first image on the top and the last image on the bottom. This means that I get a warning every time I preview or render my site because the partial can’t find one or two of the other urls, but I’m ok with that!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample warning\n\n\n\n/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto/featured.png (404: Not Found)"

These redirects primarily have the task of redirecting my rbind.io domain to my custom domain silviacanelon.com.\n\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\nmanual_redirects &lt;-\n  readr::read_table(here::here(\"static\", \"_manualredirects.txt\"),\n                    col_names = FALSE) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(redirect = paste0(X1, \" \", X2, \" \", X3))\n\nmanual_redirects &lt;- manual_redirects$redirect\n\nhead(manual_redirects)\n\n\n[1] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/authors/silvia/avatar.png https://silviacanelon.com/about/sidebar/avatar.png 301!\"\n[2] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/post/* https://silviacanelon.com/blog/:splat 301!\"                                \n[3] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/blog/* https://silviacanelon.com/blog/:splat 301!\"                                \n[4] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/talk/* https://silviacanelon.com/talk/:splat 301!\"                                \n[5] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/project/* https://silviacanelon.com/project/:splat 301!\"                          \n[6] \"http://silvia.rbind.io/* https://silviacanelon.com/:splat 301!\"                                           \n\n\nListing subdirectories\nThe next step defines a function that obtains a list of subdirectories, iterates it over the four groups of posts in my site (blog posts, talks, publications, and projects), and compiles the files into a data frame.\n\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n# function: obtain list of post paths\nlist_paths &lt;- function(folder) {\n  posts &lt;-\n    list.dirs(\n    path = c(here::here(folder)),\n    full.names = FALSE,\n    recursive = FALSE\n    ) |&gt; \n    tibble::as_tibble_col(column_name = \"path\")  |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(folder = folder)\n}\n\n# define post folders\nfolders &lt;- c(\"blog\", \"project\", \"publication\", \"talk\")\n\n# list post paths by folder\nposts &lt;- purrr::map(folders, list_paths) |&gt; purrr::list_rbind()\n\nhead(posts)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nDefining redirects\nThis next chunk removes the month and day from year-month-day-slug so that I’m left with shorter paths with the format year-slug, and uses these paths and the folders they are housed in to create redirects.\nThe resulting redirects will point the short year-slug link to this blog post:\nhttps://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-hello-quarto\nTo the longer year-month-day-slug Quarto link to this post:\nhttps://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto\n\n# extract short paths and create redirects\nposts &lt;- \n  posts |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    # extract the year-slugs\n    short_path = stringr::str_remove(path, \"(?!\\\\d{4}-)\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2}-(?!\\\\d)\"),\n    # create short paths\n    short_path = paste0(folder, \"/\", short_path),\n    # create lines to insert to a netlify _redirect file\n    redirects = paste0(\"/\", short_path, \" \", \"/\", folder, \"/\", path)\n    )\n\nhead(posts)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWriting redirects file\nThe last step takes the redirects from the data frame produced in the previous step, combines them with the manual redirects, and writes them to a new text file _redirects. This file is written into the _site folder where my Quarto site is rendered, and where Netlify will know to find it.\n\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n# extract redirects\nredirects &lt;- posts$redirects\n\n# combine with manual redirects\nredirects_combined &lt;- c(manual_redirects, redirects)\n\n# write the _redirect file\nwriteLines(redirects_combined, here::here(\"_site\", \"_redirects\"))"

My hope is that the notes I took in this blog post help provide some stepping stones for folks making the transition from blogdown sites, and offer some ideas for what is possible with the flexibility of this new publishing framework. I, for one, am looking forward to growing my digital garden with Quarto tools 🌱."

In order to mitigate this issue, recycling industries have emerged with the associated logistics chain that also has an environmental impact, notably with the production of greenhouse gas. In addition to using energy to transform plastic waste into source material, energy is also wasted to transport it. In parallel to reducing plastic waste, it may be recycled at a very local scale, reducing transportation and allowing potential improvement of the collecting process. Assuming that local transformation of plastic waste is possible, this article describes the design, assembly, and setup of the hardware, system architecture, and software of collectors that may be used by these recycling units. The specificity of these collectors is that they produces on-line data related to the quantity of waste collected. Once implemented, a network of smart collectors should allow the reduction of travel to collect waste as it notifies when the collectors are full. It also produces data on the scale of a territory to optimize the supply chain related to plastic waste collection. This article presents the design and engineering aspects as well as limitations induced by technical choices, but also potential improvements for future developments."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Type I collag een morphology can be characterized using fibril D-spacing, a metric which describes the periodicity of repeating bands of gap and overlap regions of collagen molecules arranged into collagen fibrils. This fibrillar structure is stabilized by enzymatic crosslinks initiated by lysyl oxidase (LOX), a step which can be disrupted using β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). Murine in vivo studies have confirmed effects of BAPN on collagen nanostructure and the objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanism of these effects in vitro by measuring D-spacing, evaluating the ratio of mature to immature crosslinks, and quantifying gene expression of type I collagen and LOX. Osteoblasts were cultured in complete media, and differentiated using ascorbic acid, in the presence or absence of 0.25mM BAPN-fumarate. The matrix produced was imaged using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 2D Fast Fourier transforms were performed to extract D-spacing from individual fibrils. The experiment was repeated for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The D-spacing distribution of collagen produced in the presence of BAPN was shifted toward higher D-spacing values, indicating BAPN affects the morphology of collagen produced in vitro, supporting aforementioned in vivo experiments. In contrast, no difference in gene expression was found for any target gene, suggesting LOX inhibition does not upregulate the LOX gene to compensate for the reduction in aldehyde formation, or regulate expression of genes encoding type I collagen. Finally, the mature to immature crosslink ratio decreased with BAPN treatment and was linked to a reduction in peak percent area of mature crosslink hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP). In conclusion, in vitro treatment of osteoblasts with low levels of BAPN did not induce changes in genes encoding LOX or type I collagen, but led to an increase in collagen D-spacing as well as a decrease in mature crosslinks."
