  Hi, Let me introduce you
---

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a research associate at the - [Équipe de Recherche de Processus Innovatif  -ERPI](https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/) at the Université de Lorraine, Nancy - France.
I work specifically at the research platform Lorraine Fab Living Lab (LF2L) in subjects related to the 3D printing process. 

The research that I have developed so far is focused on the conceptualization of a circular economy through a distributed polymer recycling approach for the open source 3D printing technology. Technical and logistical characterizations are studied in the validation of each aspect of the distributed and local recycling process for this technology. I am one of the researches in charge of the Green Fablab project.
