  Hi, Let me introduce you
---

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a research associate at the  [Équipe de Recherche de Processus Innovatifs -ERP-I](https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/) at the Université de Lorraine, Nancy - France.
I work specifically at the research platform [Lorraine Fab Living Lab (LF2L](https://lf2l.fr/) in the project of [Green Fablab](https://lf2l.fr/projects/Green-Fablab).

My main research  is based on the distributed recycling via additive manufacturing (DRAM) approach as a possible socio-technical transition towards a sustainable manufacturing approach in a post-growth future alternative.
This broad topic leads me to many interesting fields including the technical aspects  of the additive manufacturing process, the sustainability sciences including industrial ecology, transitions & socio-technical systems,  ecosystem services, conviviality / appropriate technologies and the commons.
Finally,  imaging the Circular / Post-growth approaches for the future economy is a challenging and interest exercise in my researcher journey.
I try to come up with a diversity of methodological tools including experimental design, operational research, life cycle thinking and system dynamics to better understand the future of a circular economy through a distributed polymer recycling approach for the open source 3D printing technology.
Without forgetting the love that I have for tools like Latex, #Rstats and some programming
