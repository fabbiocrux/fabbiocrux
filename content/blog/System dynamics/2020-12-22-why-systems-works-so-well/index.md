- System purposes need not be human purposes and are not necessar- ily those intended by any single actor within the system. In fact, one of the most frustrating aspects of systems is that the purposes of subunits may add up to an overall behavior that no one wants. No one intends to produce a society with rampant drug addiction and crime, but consider the combined purposes and consequent actions of the actors involved

- Systems can be nested within systems. Therefore, there can be purposes
within purposes. The purpose of a university is to discover and preserve knowledge and pass it on to new generations

- A system generally goes on being itself, changing only slowly if at all, even with complete substitutions of its elements—as long as its interconnections and purposes remain intact.

- Changing interconnections in a system can change it dramatically. Changes 

- The elements, the parts of systems we are most likely to notice, are often (not always) least important in defining
the unique characteristics of the system—unless changing an element also
results in changing relationships or purpose.

-  A leader can make that land and those factories and people play a different game with new rules, or can direct the play toward a new purpose.



## Rules of the systems dynamics game

- And third, the systems dynamics models *explores possible futures and ask "what if" questions*. 

 - A stock if the memory of the history changing flow within the system
- If you understand the dynamics of stocks and flows --their behaviour over time-- you understand a good deal about the behaviour of complex systems.

- On top of that, when we do focus on flows, we tend to focus on inflows more easily than on outflows. Therefore, we sometimes miss seeing that we can fill a bathtub not only by increasing the inflow rate, but also by decreasing the outfl ow rate.

- The tub can’t fi ll up immediately, even with the inflow faucet on full blast. A stock takes time to change, because fl ows take time to flow. That’s a vital point, a key to understanding why systems behave as they do. Stocks usually change slowly. They can act as delays, lags, buffers, ballast, and sources of momentum in a system.

-There is one more important principle about the role of stocks in systems, a principle that will lead us directly to the concept of feedback. 
The presence of stocks allows inflows and outflows to be 

Stocks allow inflows and independent of each other and temporarily out of outflows to be decoupled balance with each other.
 
- Most individual and institutional decisions are designed to regulate the levels in stocks. If inventories rise too high, then prices are cut or advertising budgets are increased, so that sales will go up and inventories will fall.

- - It’s a question about how good the model is. Does it capture the inherent dynamics of the system? Regardless of whether you think the driving factors will do that, would the system behave like that if they did?


## Thinking in feedbacks

- A feedback loop is a closed chain of causal connections from a stock, through a set of decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are dependent on the level of the stock, and back again through a fl ow to change the stock

- That mechanism operates through a feedback loop. It is the consistent behavior pattern over a long period of time that is the fi rst hint of the existence of a feedback loop.

- A feedback loop is formed when changes in a stock affect the fl ows into or out of that same stock. A feedback loop can be quite simple and direct.


- This kind of stabilizing, goal-seeking, regulating loop is called a balanc-ing feedback loop, so I put a B inside the loop in the diagram. Balancing feedback loops are goal-seeking or stability-seeking.

- Balancing feedbacks loops are equilibratin or goal-seeking structures in systems and both sources of stability and sources of resistas to change.


### Reinforcing feedback loop

- The second kind of feedback loop is ampliyin, reinforcin, sel-multiplying, snowballing -- a vicios circle that can cause healthy growth or runaway destruction. 



- Resilience has many definitions, depending on the branch of engineer-ing, ecology, or system science doing the defi ning. 
For our purposes, the normal dictionary meaning will do: “the ability to bounce or spring back
into shape, position, etc., after being pressed or stretched. Elasticity. The ability to recover strength, spirits, good humor, or any other aspect quickly.”
