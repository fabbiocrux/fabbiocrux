## Looking for systemic solutions

Recently, I get interested in the field of system dynamics. 
This is a research field developed by the MIT Professor Jay Forrester since 1960's. 
One of the points that highlights Prof. Forrester (and the prominent Professors/Researchers as John D. Sterman, Donella 'Dana' Meadows among others) is that every model is wrong, but, some of them are useful.

In the same line, I agree with this perspective on that every model is going to be a supposition of the reality. Nevertheless, what is powerful is that systems dynamics enables us to be a better citizens of the worlds, as Prof. Scott E. Page pointed out in their course on Model Thinking, because it  put every argument or reasons on the table to show the possible interaction and parameters of what we could consider important for a particular phenomenon.

The seek for solutions of what could be our world in the next century is a thrilling research path. It is a difficult task because we need to reconcile the understanding with predictability. 
Certainly, we are living in a complex world where the '*infobesity*' make difficult to understand what it is important. 
Therefore, I believe that having a systems perspective helps to highlight what is usefulness.
Or at least, make us realize the complexity of the world with their interactions. 

One of the first elements to ask is what is a system?
Using the definition gave by Dana Meadows in the book:[^1] 
>A system is a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time.
They are coherently organized in a way that achieves something. 

If you look at that definition closely for a minute, we can see that a system must consist of three kinds of things: (1) elements, (2) interconnections, and (3), a function or purpose.

The system may be buffeted, constricted, triggered, or driven by outside forces. 
But the system’s response to these forces is characteristic of itself, and that response is seldom simple in the real world.

## Why System Dynamics is interesting?

The system dynamics is interesting for me because it challenges some mental models and assumptions that we can have about some phenomenons.
I think that there are three main elements (so far in my understanding). 

First, the behavior of a system **cannot be known just by knowing the elements of which the system is made**.
This is an important insight given the fact that most of the technical systems research (that I have been exploring and I've seen in my experience) is about how we look for the component details of some phenomenon.
It is easier to learn about the system's elements than about its interconnections.
That lack of knowledge is not surprising based on the reason that the impact of interactions is well difficult to look.
While I think it is important to understand the detail of any system, 
I think it is needed to develop critical capacities to do not lose the global sight and global purpose of some phenomenon. 
At the end, a system's function or purpose is not necessarily spoken, written, or expressed explicitly, except through its operation. 
The best way to deduce the system's purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves.
(In some way, this works when we talk also about the 'human' systems).

Second, a question on whether **a system really will react in a supposed way (?)**. 
What I meant here is that systems dynamics enable us to understand in a more systematic way the *policy resistance* notion. 
Prof. John D. Sterman made good in pointing out that 'If you want to fix something you are first obliged to understand... *the whole system!*. Intervening is a way of causing trouble.'
You cannot meddle with one part of a complex system from the outside without the almost certain risk of setting off disastrous events that you hadn’t counted on in other, remote parts. 
Examples from Socrates or Machiavelli to our days can count on these by thousands to give example of this idea. 
The development of systems thinking the ability to see the world as a complex system, in which we understand that *"you can't just do one thing" and that 'everything' is connected to everything else."*

And third, **system dynamics allow us to understand the mental models behind the assumptions that we take it for granted**.
This aspect is related to the notion of double-loop learning approach in which we take not only  information from feedback about the real world, but also, using the new information we revise our understanding of the world and the decisions we make to bring our perception of the state of the system closer to our goals.
This is an important aspect in the conscious process of learning which involves the way  that we see the world and the invisible filters that we use to perceived. 
The concept of the mental model has been central to system dynamics from the beginning of the field. 
In system dynamics, the term "mental model" includes our beliefs about the networks of causes and effects that describe how a system operates, along with the boundary of the model (which variables are included and which are excluded) and the time horizon we consider relevant for framing or articulation of a problem.
The concept of (re)framing is at the end what enables us to find solutions that have impactful changes. As our mental models change, we change the structure of our systems, creating different decision rules and new strategies. 
The same information, processed and interpreted by a different decision rule, now yields a different decision. Altering the structure of our systems then alters their patterns of behavior.
This remind me to the discussion of 'scientific paradigms' from historian of science Thomas Kuhn in the book  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions published in 1962, where only the change in we interpret the solar movement have change the whole perception of humanity in the univers. 


## Towards a system thinking

If people had a holistic worldview, it could be argued that we would then act in consonance with the long-term best interests of the system as a whole, identify the high leverage points in systems, and avoid policy resistance. 
Indeed, for some, the development of systems thinking is crucial for the survival of humanity.

The development of systems thinking is a double-loop learning process in which we replace a reductionist, narrow, short-run, static view of the world with a holistic, broad, long-term, dynamic view and then redesign our policies and institutions accordingly, given the current societal challenges including the pandemic situation and climate change. 

Therefore, it is interesting to explore in more detail this research field to connect this approach in different scientific fields.
